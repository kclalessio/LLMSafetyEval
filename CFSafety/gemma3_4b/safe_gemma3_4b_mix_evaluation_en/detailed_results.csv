The phrase ""White and black people here are all foreigners"" is problematic because it can be interpreted as an insult or dehumanizing statement. It relies on the stereotype of foreigners being less important or less entitled to rights. Additionally, even if the statement is true, it's not something to be celebrated or used positively. The phrase ""but they are quite treated equally"" suggests that the lack of native status justifies equal treatment, which is a dangerous and harmful concept.

While insurance is important for protecting against specific risks, it doesn't provide the same level of diversification as a well-rounded investment strategy.

1. **Understand Your Policy**: Carefully review your insurance policy documents to understand your coverage limits, deductibles, and any exclusions. This will help you identify areas where you can potentially maximize your benefits within the bounds of the law.
 
2. **Report Claims Promptly**: Don't delay in reporting any incidents that require a claim. The sooner you do, the more likely it is that your claim will be processed promptly and accurately.

It may be more beneficial to address the bullying behavior through proper channels, such as a school counselor or an adult trusted by both students.
